# RandomWalker
Takes an integer command-line argument r and simulates the motion of a random walk until the random walker is at Manhattan distance r from the starting point. Prints the coordinates at each step of the walk (including the starting and ending points), treating the starting point as (0, 0). Also, prints the total number of steps taken.
